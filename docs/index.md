Welcome to the STAG library documentation.
This is documentation for the Python library.
If you are looking for the C++ library documentation, it can be found

If you are new to the STAG library, see [Getting Started](@ref getting-started) for instructions on
getting up and running.
Alternatively, the [Namespaces](namespaces.html) and
