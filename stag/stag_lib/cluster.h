   * Spectral clustering algorithm.
   *
   * This is a simple graph clustering method, which provides a clustering of the entire graph.
   * To use spectral clustering, simply pass a `stag::Graph` object
   * and the number of clusters you would like to find.
   *

   *       std::vector<stag_int> clusters = stag::spectral_cluster(&myGraph, 2);

   *         std::cout << c << ", ";

   *       std::cout << std::endl;
   *
   *       return 0;
   *     }
   * \endcode
   * 
   * The spectral clustering algorithm has the following steps.
   *   - Compute the \f$k\f$ smallest eigenvectors of the normalised Laplacian matrix.
   *   - Embed the vertices into \f$\mathbb{R}^k\f$ according to the eigenvectors.
   *   - Cluster the vertices into \f$k\f$ clusters using a \f$k\f$-means clustering algorithm.
   *
   * @param graph the graph object to be clustered
   * @param k the number of clusters to find. Should be less than \f$n/2\f$.
   * @return a vector giving the cluster membership for each vertex in the graph

   * Find the Cheeger cut in a graph.
   *
   * Let \f$G = (V, E)\f$ be a graph and \f$\mathcal{L}\f$ be its normalised Laplacian
   * matrix with eigenvalues \f$0 = \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \ldots \leq \lambda_n\f$.
   * Then, Cheeger's inequality states that

   * \f]
   *
   * is the conductance of \f$G\f$. The proof of Cheeger's inequality is
   * constructive: by computing the eigenvector corresponding to \f$\lambda_2\f$,
   * and performing the sweep set operation, we are able to find a set \f$S\f$
   * with conductance close to the optimal. The partition returned by this
   * algorithm is called the 'Cheeger cut' of the graph.
   *
   * @param graph the graph object to be partitioned
   * @return A vector giving the cluster membership for each vertex in the graph.
   *         Each entry in the vector is either \f$0\f$ or \f$1\f$ to indicate
   *         which side of the cut the vertex belongs to.
