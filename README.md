# STAGPy - Spectral Toolkit of Algorithms for Graphs

STAG is a library providing efficient spectral algorithms for the analysis of massive graphs. STAGPy is a python wrapper around the underlying C++ library which provides convenient methods for learning on graphs in python.

## Project Status
The STAG library is under active development. Further documentation will be added here in the near future.

## Acknowledgements
The development of this library is part of He Sun's Fellowship  titled "Efficient Spectral Algorithms for Massive and Dynamic Graphs", which is funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC, EP/T00729X/1). The development team of this library consists of [Peter Macgregor](https://pmacg.github.io/index.html) and [He Sun](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/index.html).
