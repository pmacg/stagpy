# STAGPy - Spectral Toolkit of Algorithms for Graphs

STAG is a library providing efficient spectral algorithms for the analysis of massive graphs. STAGPy is a python wrapper around the underlying c++ library which provides convenient methods for learning on graphs in python.

## Project Status
The STAG library is under active development. Further documentation will be added here in the near future.

## Acknowledgements
The development of the STAG library is funded by the EPSRC Fellowship titled "Efficient Spectral Algorithms for Massive and Dynamic Graphs", awarded to [He Sun](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/index.html).
