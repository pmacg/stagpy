# STAGPy - Spectral Toolkit of Algorithms for Graphs

STAG is a library providing efficient spectral algorithms for the analysis of massive graphs. STAGPy is a python wrapper around the underlying C++ library which provides convenient methods for learning on graphs in python.

## Project Status
The STAG library is under active development. Further documentation will be added here in the near future.
